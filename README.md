# Hello-World
First Run - Github
She was with the wind moving in the deserted streets when she first saw you. Sitted in that corner. Wrapped in a rags alone and blowing air into your palms. She wished to keep you company, to be close, to hug you, to bring you solace. So she moved closer to embrace you and with every shiver she hugged you tighter. With every warmth you relinquished, she moved in to consume you more and make you part of the elements, part of her. She wished you could ride the wind across the continent above the trees and the buildings, to see the beauty of the world. And when you fell to the ground, she wrapped herself around you and didn't let go. All through the night she stayed by your side and finally saw you move with the wind. She smiled and hugged you more and when the sun came and took you from her, she cried till she was no more that a pool of water.
